# 3D Engine , Part 1

1. Triangles & Projection

- I'm going to suggest that all of our dots are grouped into triangles
    - any 2D primitive can be represented using nothing but triangles
- Finally when it comes to drawing triangles on a screen there are some very optimized algorithms to do this, because a triangle consists of straight lines.
    - and there are also some neat algorithms to fill in a triangle and shade it on the screen, again using straight horizontal lines.

- There is somethign important about the triangles, the order of the vertices we define the triangle. 
    - I want to always use a clockwise order.

    - exactly the same for the remaining faces.
