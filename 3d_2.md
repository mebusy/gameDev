# 3D Engine 2: Normals, Culling, Lighting & Object Files

Let's remove the triangles that we can't see.

3D engines exploit 2 main things.firstly vertex geometry, and the normals to the surface.

A normal is an imaginary line which is perpendicular to the plane that contains the triangles.

Our model doesn't contain any normal data. We're going to generate it as and when we need it. This will differ from 3d engine to 3d engine implementations. As the engines become more sophisticated you will in fact see that is quite common to include normal information as part of the model. Fortunately there are some geometric techniques for getting normals -- cross product.

Crudely speaking any of the triangles that have a normal whose z component is negative we can see, whereas those that have a normal that have a positive z component we can't. 

So knowing the z component we can crudely optimize our cube to be consisting of only triangles that we can see. And we'll see shortly **this isn't entirely true**, and we can do a better job.

If we calculate the normal before we do projection, we can still see that there are faces that we shouldn't be able to see.

This is because we've not taken projection into account. We've got nothing that says where the eye is in the world space relative to where that normal is. And traditionally this is where we would introduce the concept of a camera.
